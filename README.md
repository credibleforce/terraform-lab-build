# Terraform Lab Build

This project provides a template for building student lab in AWS. Inspiration for this project was taken from the amazing work done for the [Splunk Attack Range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range) project.

Everything here is currently a work in progress but has been successfully used to deliver multiple workshops.
